node,Using Copybara with deploy keys?,"We would like to give Copybara access to the origin repo using a read only deploy key and the destination repo using a read/write deploy key. GitHub does not allow the same SSH key to be used as a deploy key in two different repos.

It's not clear to me how to do this with Copybara. A common trick when using git to access different repos with different keys is explained here: https://gist.github.com/gubatron/d96594d982c5043be6d4 - however this appears not to work with Copybara as there is a check for the GitHub hostname in the code [1].

Is there a way to use different keys to access different repos with Copybara? If not, please could it be added e.g. by allowing the `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` environment variable to be specified on a per-repo basis?

Thanks.

node,How to remove the GitOrigin-RevId label,"Hi,

I was wondering how the GitOrigin-RevId label can be removed. I've tried using metadata.remove_label in the transformations, but it doesn't remove it.

Sorry if this isn't the appropriate place for this question. I tried posting in the google groups forum, but it wouldn't let me due to permissions

Cheers,

node,git.origin -> git.github_pr_destination fails when specifying a SHA-1 `ref` on the origin,"I'm attempting to write a macro for a workflow which will take a public Git SoT (`git.origin` is necessary, since this can be sources other than `github` or `gerrit`). I'd like to submit this import as a PR to a private github destination (via `git.github_pr_destination`).

The workflow that gets generated is pretty simple:

```
    core.workflow(
        name = ""some_foo_name"",
        mode = ""SQUASH"",
        origin = git.origin(
            url = url,
            ref = ""someCommitHash"",
        ),
        destination = git.github_pr_destination(
            url = private_url,
            destination_ref = ""master"",
            pr_branch = ""import/some_foo_name/${CONTEXT_REFERENCE}"",
        ),
        <snip...>
```

However, when running this workflow, I get a error stating that I need to specify the `pr_branch` for this:

```
ERROR: git.github_pr_destination is incompatible with the current origin. Origin has to be able to provide the contextReference or use '--github-destination-pr-branch' flag
```

Am I going about this incorrectly? What is a more idiomatic way to do this?"

node,Usage question,"I'm evaluating Copybara but the lack of documentation makes it a bit hard to understand some basic concepts.

Let's suppose there a private repo A and a public repo B, both hosted on Github. B is a filtered version of A, in the sense that some files and folders are removed. Most work (internal) will happen on A, but some public contributions might happen on B as pull requests. My understanding so far is that I would have to setup webhooks on both repos. On A to mirror branches to B on commits, and on B to mirror PRs to A.

Is my understanding correct?

thank you for the product and your attention!"

This PR adds a dices 'I'm feeling lucky' of the Google Play Music app and the Nexus One cross rotation progress drawables.

node,Better support for updating dependencies,Currently Copybara allows to move code from one repo to another. It can be used with some hacks to update a repo based on changes from another repo (see #84 for details). We should improve this and make it less hacky. Some ideas:

   - Multiple sources origin

  - Don't require origin/destination files and/or don't require a checkout.

  - Custom RevId that contains the dependency.
node,Feature Request: ability to re-order accounts,Original [issue 190](https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/issues/detail?id=190) created by stewartl42 on 2012-07-09T20:58:16.000Z:

<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Open the App
2. accounts are listed in the order they were added and cannot be re-ordered

<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
The method used to re-order the accounts is not important.

<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>

node,Hash being overwritten if identificators have the same name,"While scanning a QR code to help my friend setup an account for a service we both use, the authenticator simply overwrote my previous hash and put his in it's place, instead of either creating another entry or simply giving me a prompt asking me if I confirm the operation.

As a side note, now I can't recover my acess to said service anymore, since I don't possess the unlock code  and seemingly there's no google account linked to that hash. I can't believe such a thing really wasn't thought about, it's a basic security flaw.

node,Workflow best practices for migration of GitHub code into internal repo,"This looks like a great tool, and would be of use to us on some upcoming projects. Thanks for open sourcing it!

One question I have (I can't seem to find a better forum for Q's) is around best practices for integrating changes from GitHub with an internal authoritative repo.

This is mentioned in the README:

> Importing a change from a non-authoritative repository into the authoritative repository. When a change is made in the non-authoritative repository (for example, a contributor in the public repository), Copybara transforms and moves that change into the appropriate place in the authoritative repository. Any merge conflicts are dealt with in the same way as an out-of-date change within the authoritative repository.

Concretely, say someone opens a PR on your GitHub repo. What does the process look like for integrating that change into the internal repo? Is the change first merged into the GitHub repo then migrated to the internal repo? Or is there some way to do some kind of initial vetting to know that the change is compatible with the internal repo before merging the change in GitHub, then moving? I've often wondered how this is done on some of the PRs I've submitted to Google GitHub projects.

Happy to offer up some documentation in a PR once I grok this concept.

Thanks again for open sourcing the tool!"

I was wondering if this is the best way to accomplish overlaying a public README.md from an internal repo. I'm asking this publicly because I'm not 100% sure how to dry run the copybara stuff and see what a public repo will look like, and as well to just see if there is a better way to accomplish this. I think the core.replace stuff is a bit too granular, in this case replacing the file completely seems to make the most sense.

node,"Authenticator crashes on ""start setup""","**What steps will reproduce the problem?**
1. Open Authentication
2. Try to put Begin Setup button
3. Immediately unfortunately, authentication has stopped

**What is the expected output? What do you see instead?**
Immediately unfortunately, authentication has stopped

**What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?**
Package version 49
package version name: 2.49
On Android
device: LG G3

**Please provide any additional information below.**

This issue was originally reported on google code (https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/issues/detail?id=353) and then reopened on github (https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/issues/346) but both records are closed.
However the issue still occurs.

**Workaround**
Originally posted on google code and reproduced at http://lifeisabug.com/google-authenticator-crashes-account-setup-workaround/
1. Open Authenticator but do NOT press the “Begin setup” button.
2. Instead, select “setup account” from the option menu.
3. Then from another device, go to https://accounts.google.com/b/0/SmsAuthSettings, select “Move to a different phone” and scan the QR code.

node,Merges as commits when first_parent=False,"Hello,

I trying to bring gitlab support to copybara for my company, but in the process I discovered issue with git -> git synchronization.

In default configuration merges are squashed to single commit and in branch based workflows this disrupts whole git history, therefore I tried `first_parent=False` option in `git.origin` and it copies both sides of merge as it should, but it isn't able to copy merges, as they are treated as usual commits and they usually doesn't  contain any changes.

This disrupts closing github PR when branch is merged on gitlab side and it caused also merge conflicts when on other branches after one of them was merged.

I tried to find a way to fix that in cohybara source code, but it looks like `isMerge` info is lost many calls up in stack trace before it reaches writer.

        ref = ""master"",

All of our tags are for commits on `master`. I assumed that I could simply run this with `origin.ref = ""refs/tags/<tag>""` and `destination.push = ""refs/tags/<tag>""`. When I do this I get this output:
```

This makes sense as the commit already exists on `destination:master`, but I would still expect it to push it to the tag. Am I holding it wrong / is there a better way to handle this use case? Or is it a bug and it should still push to the tag?"

Good job mate for this library! A couple of comments there:
- you should set the antialias to the paints, I've tried and it looks better

Good idea anyway!

If the device is compromised, the attacker can potentially compromise the account secured by the secret key.

The implementation should be similar to [Yubico Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yubico.yubioath). That would allow to secure applications which do not support YubiKey directly.

I'm gearing up to do a demo of copybara for @sonatype tomorrow, and I was curious, what do you all do to import a pull request? I can add this to the docs as an example as well.

What I basically want to do is:

- I have a private source repo
- PR comes in from public destination repo
- Run copybara to bring the PR in to the source repo (so we can noodle on it, make adjustments if we need to)
- Merge that PR
- Run copybara and have the changes make it out to the destination

I see some stuff around the source PR, etc... but figured I would ask more so about workflow related to this.

Thanks!"

node,Working with LFS repositries,"Hi there,

Can copybara operate with repositories with files managed by Git LFS? My scenario is as follows:

- I have a private repository on github that has many artifacts (some of which are large files which are managed by LFS). This repository acts as a source repository.
- I also have another private repository on github which acts as the target repository.
- The source repository gets frequent pushes, and from time to time we need to selectively copy certain files from it to the target repository.
- when using copybara to do so, we get an error message during the task: ""Git Destination: Checking out master"":
```
Error downloading object: (...): batch request: missing protocol: """"
Errors logged to (...)
Use `git lfs logs last` to view the log.

which seems as a problem with relevant to git-lfs.

So does copybara support repositories with LFS-managed files?"

node,Avoid showing any codes right after screen unlock,"The problem is, if the phone was locked with the app running, it will show current codes right after unlock to anyone watching over the shoulder, security cameras, TV crews etc.

There are multiple ways to avoid this, e.g.:
* close app completely on screen lock (the behaviour I'd personally expect and accept);
* implement #37 after unlock (would solve more general problem of exposing unneeded codes);
* ask for user confirmation after unlock (inelegant but probably easier to understand for some)."

Suggestion to create a mechanism to retrieve OTP over bluetooth for the Android Google Authenticator Application

User would put the cursor on a text box in the browser and then hit a (configurable) key combination (e.g. CTRL+SHIFT+i) and it would automatically get an OTP code from the phone´s application and paste it into the text box.

This would probably need an accompaining Mac and Windows client aplication that would have to run as a service and intercept the key combination in order to then request the code to the phone.

This would make the usage of OTP much more practical.

node,Access current data model from within OnButttonPressListener?,"OnButtonPressListener provides only a reference to TextView textView. So my question ist how to access the current card (and its metadata stored inside it) from within the Listener?
Is it good practice to declare a card instance final in order to access it from within the listener?

Example:

``` java
      BasicButtonsCard card = new BasicButtonsCard();
      card.setTitle(dataPojo.getTitle());
      card.setDescription(dataPojo.getSource());
      card.setLeftButtonText(""Dislike"");
      card.setRightButtonText(""Like"");
      card.setShowDivider(true);
      card.setDismissible(true);
      card.setOnLeftButtonPressedListener(new OnButtonPressListener() {
        @Override
        public void onButtonPressedListener(TextView textView) {
           //Accessing ""card"" right here would only be possible if it was declared 'final'
           restClient.postUpdate(""Dismiss"", card.getTitle()); 
          card.dismiss(); 
        }
      });
      materialListView.add(card);
```

For me it would be great if onButtonPressListener would also provide access to the card like

``` java
onButtonPressedListener(TextView textView, Card currentCard)
```

node,Add smart prune support to GitDestination,Smart prune support works by only adding files from
TransformResult.getAffectedFilesForSmartPrune to the git index. This
causes files that only changed due to non-reversible transforms to be
excluded from the commit.

Smart prune is also a large performance improvement when the workflow's
destination_files are a small subset of a large monorepo. The behavior
without smart prune is to remove most of the SoT repo from the index
only to then add it back in AddExcludedFilesToIndex.

I am not sure if the git smart prune behavior matches that of other
destinations because getAffectedFilesForSmartPrune was only used in a
few tests in the OSS codebase. But given the API of TransformResult I
am assuming the piper destination must be doing something similar.

With a layout like that, you could fit 10 or 12 codes on the screen and still have them as readable. Although also, assigning each a random pastel colour would also help to distinguish them, and making the grey text a lighter grey would improve matters too.

node,get OTP over Bluetooth,"hi all. when i worked at google, i loved that i could get an OTP over bluetooth and confirm by knocking on my phone while it was in my pocket (to prevent unauthorized requests). any chance you could add that to this open source app? thanks in advance!

original issue google/google-authenticator#176. original original [issue 177](https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/issues/detail?id=177) in google code project:

> Suggestion to create a mechanism to retrieve OTP over bluetooth for the Android Google Authenticator Application
> 
> User would put the cursor on a text box in the browser and then hit a (configurable) key combination (e.g. CTRL+SHIFT+i) and it would automatically get an OTP code from the phone´s application and paste it into the text box.
> 
> This would probably need an accompaining Mac and Windows client aplication that would have to run as a service and intercept the key combination in order to then request the code to the phone.
> 
> This would make the usage of OTP much more practical.

node,"Styles, Templates, Empty View, Simplifications, Code Refactoring, Animations, Actions","- **Material Styles**: Created a material_styles.xml with the font specific
  stuff (like text size and style of title).
- **Template layouts**: Added some layout components which can be easily
  added to a card layout to create cards faster.
- **Empty View**: Have to refactor the MaterialListView, because the empty
  view can not be shown, if the class is extended by RecyclerView
  directly.
- **Simplifications**: Put all the methods from Text- & Button- & default
  Provider into one single Provider class, because every card has these
  things. There is also no need any more to extend the Provider classes (often it was only used to define the layout). With the CardProvider you've got a stand alone provider.
- **Code Refactoring**: Cleaned up the code.
- **Animations**: The adapter was not notified when something changed - I mean not by the typicaly method notifyDataSetChanged(). It needs to be notified by notifyItemRemoved/notifyItemInserted/etc.
- **Actions**: Put all things together in one Provider class with the
  possibility to add ""Action""s to the views. These actions can be set
  through the builder pattern.

> The actions can not be integrated into the builder pattern like we did it bevor with the CardProvider :-1: due to the fact, that the generic types getting me so confusing and I haven't found a solution to get it integrated by now. The problem is - when trying to integrate it - the types getting into chaos and I don't know why. When I try to do something like this...

node,destination_files behaviour,"I am attempting to use copybara to migrate many standalone repos into a monorepo, and use copybara to keep them in step while we are in the process of migration. However I am hitting an issue with the behaviour of destination_files, or perhaps my understanding of it.

The following in the config used
```
core.workflow(
    name = ""default"",
    origin = git.origin(
        url = origin_url,
        ref = ""master"",
    ),
    destination = git.destination(
        url = dest_url,
        fetch = ""master"",
        push = ""copybara/microtime_import"",
    ),
    ask_for_confirmation = True,
    destination_files = glob([""libs/microtime/**""]),
    origin_files = glob([""**""]),
    authoring = authoring.pass_thru(""Copybara <cc@internal>""),
    transformations = [
	    core.move("""", ""libs/microtime""),
    ],
)
```

When this runs, it removes **all** other files in the destination repo, unless they are matched by an `exclude` in `destination_files`, which seems to go against the line in the docs:

```
A glob relative to the root of the destination repository that matches files that are part of the migration. Files NOT matching this glob will never be removed, even if the file does not exist in the source.
```

How can I get copybara to import from the the origin repo and only affect the destination folder?

node,Secrets should be stored in a java.security.KeyStore,"Transferred from https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/issues/157

Instead of storing the secrets in the SQLite database, the SQLite database should store the alias of the SecretKey in a java.security.KeyStore. This will allow migration to more secure methods of storage in the future.

Note that you'll have to use a JCEKS instead of the default JKS.

node,Consider adding ability to momentarily pause 6-digit code from refreshing while entering it,"Please note that the code in this repository is an open source fork of the app in the Play Store, so **there is no guarantee that both apps will be in sync**. Please check which version of the app your bug applies to below.

- [x] This feature request applies to the app downloaded from the [Play Store][playstore].
- [ ] This feature request is for the [Github version][opensource] of the app.

The Google Authenticator app is maintained by a small group of 20%-ers within Google. Although we'd love to give the app some more love, engineers need to allocate limited cycles to many competing priorities. Please check the box below to make sure that we're on the same page.

- [x] I have acknowledged that filing this feature request does not obligate Google to implement my specific request.

## Feature Description

I'd like a feature in the Authenticator app that lets me *pause* the refreshing of a 6-digit code as I enter it during the sign-in process. I would like this feature because:

* I commonly enter the 6-digit codes on another device (so I can't easily copy/paste the codes from my phone)
* often the 6-digit code changes as I am entering it, causing me to start over and wish for a feature like this
* I misjudge how long it takes to memorize and copy a 6-digit random number
* I am usually too impatient to wait for the next code and believe in my ability to type fast (see previous bullet)
* even with enough time, it is still unpleasantly stressful to enter a 6-digit random number under time pressure

The ability to momentarily pause the number-refreshing addresses these issues. Won't the numbers be stale sometimes? Yes, but as long as I am within the grace period that's OK, and the app could show me how old a code is without erasing it from sight.

Here is how I see it working (though I would happily welcome any implementation):

1. you tap the code you want
2. the code is shown in full-screen (bonus: it's easier to see!)
3. when the code expires, it's not erased. Instead, the app indicates that it's stale.

![Screenshot 2020-07-16 at 2 19 42 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/153497/87708991-939d1a80-c771-11ea-8ad4-9dc1085e29f3.png)


### Why is it important?

This is important because millions of people manually enter Authenticator codes onto other devices daily, and doing so under time pressure is 1.) stressful, and 2.) often leads to wasted time and effort if the number expires or is about to expire.

This would be a simple, secure, and intuitive addition to an already great app that could relieve people of the unneeded time-pressure of using 2-factor authentication.

node,Update README.md,It should be mListView.getAdapter.add(Card) instead of mListView.add(Card)

node,Customize git binary path,"We need to customize the git binary path since we want to actually use a wrapper that:
exports some environment properties for Copybara to leverage (username, email, etc).

We tried setting `GIT_EXEC_PATH` in the env but that confuses git since we can't have wrapper sit in the actual `GIT_EXEC_PATH`.

I experimented in my repo in changing `GitRepository#resolveGitBinary` to try and first read `GIT_BINARY_PATH` from the environment and if not fallback to `GIT_EXEC_PATH` and then back to `git` (like it does today).

That solved my problem.

I'd be really happy to send a PR for this. WDYT?"
node,"ITERATIVE workflow overrides changes, CHANGE_REQUEST workflow only succeeded for a first change","Hi, I'm experimenting with git-to-git export-import scenario.
For exporting from private repo to public repo I'm using ITERATIVE workflow with git.github_origin and git.github_destination.
And for importing form public repo to private repo I'm using CHANGE_REQUEST workflow with git.github_origin and git.github_pr_destination.

This setup does work for me in some cases, however in some other cases it doesn't. 

Issue 1
When running ITERATIVE workflow (exporting priv-->pub), copybara replaces all files changed in the destination with their earlier revisions existing in the origin. Copybara probably fails to find the baseline commit in this scenario but I don't see any errors or warnings. 

Issue 2
When running CHANGE_REQUEST workflow (importing priv<--pub) it works perfect for a first change but fails for subsequent change.
Consider the following scenario:
1. in the dest repo add 'line 1' to dest.txt file.
2. run copybara import --> PR in the origin githab repo is created.
3. accept the PR (merge or rebase - it doesn't matter), delete the branch
4. optionally (the entire scenario fails either way) run copybara export --> ""Iterative workflow produced no changes in the destination for resolved ref: 1234""
5. in the dest repo add 'line 2' to dest.txt file.
6. run copybara import --> `ERROR: Conflict detected while rebasing <usr>/copybara/temp/workdir2115951859017918467/checkout to 1234.`

Checking the failed patch at `<usr>/copybara/cache/git_repos/<repo url>/rebase-apply/patch`
reveals that it contains additions for both 'line 1' and 'line 2' to dest.txt file.

The only fix I've found for this condition is to remove the patch and run copybara export. This time change '1234' (the first one) would pass through and be pushed to the dest. But this will effectively destroy all the recent changes in the dest ('line 2' in our case) - see Issue 1.

Are these issues really a bugs or desired behavior? 
Is there anything I can try to work around at least one of those?
Thank you."

node,"Add build flavors ""playStore"", ""openSource"", and ""openSourceDev""","Since this project switched to Android Studio and Gradle as build system, I think we should use some of its advantages, namely build flavors.

This pull requests adds 3 flavors: `playStore`, `openSource`, and `openSourceDev`.

The `playStore` flavor is added for completeness, as most users of this open-source version will never be able to build the official Play Store version due to missing signing credentials.

The ""openSource"" and ""openSourceDev"" flavor use a different package name, so that they can be installed concurrently on a single device, giving the user (and us developers) the possibility to use the official Play Store version as well as a productive open-source version, while still being able to perform development tasks on a separate installation, without risking our ""productive"" open-source Authenticator.

Adjustments to all `themes.xml` are necessary in order to replace qualified names with references to flavor package names. There seems to be a problem within certain XML files, where package names are not replaced with the `applicationId` from the flavor (compare http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/applicationid-vs-packagename and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28159281/android-gradle-applicationid-setting-causing-no-resource-found-in-themes-xml). 
Also replaces hard-coded references to package name in XML files for preferences.

The test instrumentation is hard-coded against the `openSourceDev` flavor, as I suppose this flavor is going to be used for the test runner during development. Please note, that some test cases fail at the moment, but this is unrelated to this pull request.

node,version 2 deserves a better project structure,"this commit will separate module ""materialList"" into two parts. 

the 1st part would still named ""materialList"". but now it would just care about the core functions. 

the 2nd part is called ""sampleCards"". and it would be a convenient extension. 

the point is when i have got to create my own cards, a core lib with smaller size would be perfect. if the ""sampleCards"" happens to fit the need, well, just one more import sentence. 

besides, a simple and clear project structure is good for development.
